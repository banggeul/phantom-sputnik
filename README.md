# Phantom Sputnik

An iOS app art project that calculates the position of the original Sputnik satellite as if it never fell out of orbit. Functioning like a shortwave radio, the app allows users to hear the transmission of the phantom satellite’s beeping signal each time it passes overhead.

Within the app, users can switch between a radio view, a map view and a satellite eye view. The map view allows users to follow the trajectory of the satellite as it orbits the earth (current location + 200 mintues ~= 2 full orbit cycles). Users can usually anticipate being in close enough proximity to hear Sputnik’s transmission twice each day ~1000km radius.) The satellite eye view shows the satellite pictures of earth from the Sputnik. 

Coming to the iTunes app store soon.
