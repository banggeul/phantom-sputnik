Phantom Sputnik

An iOS app that calculates the position of the original Sputnik satellite as if it never fell out of orbit. Functioning like a shortwave radio, the app allows users to hear the transmission of the phantom satellite’s beeping signal each time it passes overhead ( ~1000km radius). 

Within the app, users can switch between a radio view, map view and satellite eye view. 
The map view allows users to follow the trajectory of the satellite as it orbits the earth (current location + 200 mintues approx ~= 2 full orbit cycles). Users can usually anticipate being in close enough proximity to hear Sputnik’s transmission twice each day.)
